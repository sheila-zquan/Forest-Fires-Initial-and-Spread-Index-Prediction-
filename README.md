This study uses a dataset from Montesinho Natural Park to develop a linear regresssion model for the prediction of Initial Spread Index (ISI) in order to improve forest fire management. The proposed model was generated using a training dataset and tested on a validation dataset to evaluate predictive accuracy. Our proposed model shows relatively good performance for moderate ISI values in the training dataset with acceptable generalization to the validation dataset, but tends to underestimate ISI at extremely high observed values. Further improvement is still needed to ensure predictive accuracy under the most dangerous conditions.
